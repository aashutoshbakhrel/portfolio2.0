          <img src="Images/name.jpeg" alt="About Me Image" class="about-img">
        <p>Nothing much too tell. But I will try to make myself enough visible for your mind to make a small space for me to understand me, If you care. I am a boy born in Bagmati pradesh of Nepal, Who became Man when His Consciousness hit him from inside in Canada -- Specifically speaking in a place named ThunderBay.</p>
        <p>Academically Speaking, I am pretty weak at maintaining its routine and in some regards its respect. Despite obtaining over 3.5 GPA from grade 8th to grade 12 and even 4.0 GPA in 11th and 12th grade, I will call myself academical failure. Why? because I took myself in into the thin narrow space of IOE Pulchowk for Electrical Engineering obtaining pretty much good rank enough for obtaining full scholarship in IOE WRC Pokhara for Computer Engineering. But I dropped out of there Because my consciousness started knocking from inside -- " I need Computer Science Knowledge BITC*in ". I dropped there then dropped 16000 USD per year Scholarship from St. Louis University, Because My consciousness thought that place was kind of brainrott. Again got 10000 CAD scholarship from canadian university named the Topmost University for Research, I jumped there through a portal called as VISA-System and Spaceship called more often as Aeroplane. Again After staying some months and few collections of lunar revotions or months, I or My conciousness knocked even harder -- You dont even have time here to build something, go home. So collecting few coins in that planet I returned home with a spaceship rented for 2 days. And currently I am pursuing BSc honors or whatever, whatever that is enough for my consciousness. So I dropped TWO damn Bachelors degree with enormous value JUST FOR FU.N -- FUllfillment of needs ( of my consciousness).</p>
        <p>Skillwise saying, My mind loves doing things. But not one thing. I was crazy about maths so much solving only challenging questions of DR. Simkhada and trying to solve math problems differently and asking about Dark topics like Dark matter and Dark enery and all. Lol did you catch that joke about dark. .. I have developed some projects see below. Thats it.</p>

            <h3>Astrological Computational Model</h3>
            <p>An attempt to mathematically encode the ancient sky — positions, drifts, harmonics, anomalies. 
               Not prediction… translation. A bridge between human pattern-making and cosmic data. 
               Part science, part algorithmic mythology. 
               Prototype release incoming.</p>
