        <p>Nothing much to tell.<br>But I’ll make myself visible, piece by piece — hoping your mind creates a space to understand me, if you care to.</p>
        <p>I was born in Bagmati Province, Nepal — just a boy — <br>but I became a man when consciousness hit me hard, thousands of miles away, in Thunder Bay, Canada.</p>
        <p>Academically, I’ve never been disciplined.<br>
But grades never reflected that.<br>
From Grade 8 to Grade 12, I held a GPA above 3.5 — even a 4.0 in 11th and 12th.<br>
By numbers, I wasn’t a failure.<br>
By instinct, I was.</p>
<p>Why?<br>
Because I realized academics didn’t align with my consciousness — with the identity I felt growing inside.</p>
<p>I earned a rank good enough for IOE Pulchowk’s Electrical Engineering.<br>
I secured a full scholarship for Computer Engineering at IOE WRC, Pokhara.<br>
And I walked away.</p>
<p>Then I dropped a $16,000/year scholarship at St. Louis University.<br>
Then a $10,000 CAD scholarship at one of Canada’s top research universities.<br>
I travelled across systems, borders, visa portals and airplanes —<br>
and after a few lunar revolutions, my consciousness knocked again:</p>
<p><p><strong>“You don’t have time here to build something. Go home.”</strong></p>
<br>
<p>So I did.</p>
<p>I returned with nothing but clarity —<br>
and now I’m pursuing a degree that aligns with what I truly want:<br>
<i><bold>Computer Science, or anything close enough to satisfy my consciousness.</bold></i></p>
<p>Yes, I’ve dropped two valuable bachelor’s degrees.<br>
Not out of carelessness —<br>
but for FU.N: Fulfillment of Needs (of my consciousness).<br>
A strange compass, but it never lies.</p>
<p>As for skills:<br>
my mind loves doing things.<br>
Not one thing — things. Many things.<br>
Maths, problem-solving, dark topics like darkmatter, darkenery (did you catch that joke?),<br>
and building projects that feel like fragments of a bigger mind I want to create one day.</p>
<p>Below are some of the things I’ve built —<br>
pieces of me, visible enough for now.</p>

            <h3>ES-Encrypted Oracle</h3>
            <p>A custom encryption system born from the philosophy that consciousness deserves privacy. 
               Designed without copying any known ciphers — only intuition, math, and necessity. 
               Break it if you can; understand it if you dare. 
               Full documentation coming soon.</p>
        </article>

        <article class="project">
            <h3>Java Neural Network Engine</h3>
            <p>A fully hand-crafted feedforward + recurrent neural network coded from scratch in Java. 
               No libraries, no shortcuts — just pure math, gradients, eigen-thought. 
               A small brain learning inside your machine. 
               Expanding soon with auto-diff and visualizers.</p>
        </article>

        <article class="project">
            <h3>Astrological Computational Model</h3>
            <p>An attempt to mathematically encode the ancient sky — positions, drifts, harmonics, anomalies. 
               Not prediction… translation. A bridge between human pattern-making and cosmic data. 
               Part science, part algorithmic mythology. 
               Prototype release incoming.</p>
        </article>

        <article class="project">
            <h3>The Theory of Refined Domino Effect (Unpublished)</h3>
            <p>A personal philosophical-mathematical model explaining how subtle internal shifts 
               ripple outward through behaviour, destiny, and system-level emergence. 
               Written in fragments between continents. 
               Full manuscript: coming soon.</p>

        <article class="project">
            <h3>Kiwix Smart Extractor + N-Gram Autocomplete</h3>
            <p>A Python system that mines entire knowledge universes offline. 
               Feed it a topic, it hunts, extracts, filters, and builds an autocomplete intelligence from scratch. 
               A mini-LLM trained on your chosen cosmos. 
               Stable and evolving.</p>
        </article>

        <article class="project">
            <h3>DotsLife Simulation</h3>
            <p>A modular Fibonacci-logic simulation where dots replicate like living ideas. 
               Built for your universe-engine project in Java with MiniU components. 
               A growing world governed by adjacency, time, and old-dot laws. 
               Expansion patch coming soon.</p>

            <h3>Turbowriter Match-Report Generator</h3>
            <p>A text-generation system merged with a web interface — football intelligence compressed into code. 
               Parses events, generates reports, answers queries like a niche domain-LLM. 
               Lightweight, modular, alive. 
               Frontend in development.</p>

            <h3>Bhairavchakra — The Cognitive Bridge</h3>
            <p>An ongoing exploration to decode the tri-mind architecture — instinct, intellect, and awareness. 
               Not neuroscience, not philosophy: a system blueprint. 
               The first attempt to write consciousness as an algorithm. 
               Public fragments soon.</p>
